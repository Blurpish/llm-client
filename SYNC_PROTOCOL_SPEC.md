Below is a **detailed specification document** for a P2P-first syncing and AI streaming protocol that uses **WebRTC** (with [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer)) and supports an **optional “diff server”** for offline scenarios. It’s designed to handle two primary functions:

1. **Database Synchronization** (with *optional* “temp diff server”)
2. **Local AI Inference Streaming** (direct P2P, no diffs needed)

The specification covers the overall architecture, message flows, security model, and recommended data structures. You can adapt or extend it as needed for your particular application.

## 1. Overview

This protocol specifies a **peer-to-peer (P2P) first** approach for two distinct features:

- **Syncing a local RxDB database** between multiple clients.
- **Streaming local AI inference** data between clients.

The protocol emphasizes:

1. **Encrypted Communication** via a single symmetric key associated with the account, aiming for a *zero-knowledge* approach where no third party can read the synced data.
2. **P2P Transport** using **WebRTC** for direct connections when both clients are online.
3. **Optional “Diff Server”** to handle scenarios where a client is offline or otherwise unreachable, allowing partial synchronization via a small ephemeral data store.

**Key points**:

- Each client has a **unique client ID** (e.g., `clientId`).
- Each set of clients sharing a database/inference session is tied by a **common account ID** (e.g., `accountId`).
- The **diff server** is **not** a full replica or authoritative store; it only holds un-acknowledged diffs temporarily for offline clients.
- **Zero-knowledge** means all data at rest on the diff server is encrypted, so the server cannot interpret the data.

---

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### 2.1. Client
- **Generates and stores** local versions of the RxDB database.
- **Initiates and accepts** P2P WebRTC connections using [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer).
- Handles **encryption** and **decryption** of messages using the account’s symmetric key.
- Responsible for **conflict resolution** of the database changes.
- May **stream local AI inference** data to other clients over the same WebRTC connection.

### 2.2. Diff Server (Optional)
- Receives **encrypted diffs** from clients when direct P2P is not possible.
- Temporarily **stores** these diffs in a local SQLite database (or any minimal ephemeral store).
- Deletes diffs **once acknowledged** by the intended recipient.
- **Does not** do any conflict resolution or decryption.

### 2.3. Signaling Server (Required for WebRTC)
- Used for **signaling** in establishing the WebRTC connections (exchange ICE candidates, offer, answer).
- May or may not be the same host as the diff server, but logically they are separate roles.
- Does **not** store or process user data except for ephemeral signaling messages.

## 3. System Architecture

```
  ┌────────────┐       ┌────────────────┐       ┌────────────┐
  │  Client 1  │ <–––> │  P2P (WebRTC)  │ <–––> │  Client 2  │
  └────────────┘       └────────────────┘       └────────────┘
        |                          ^                    |
        |                          | (Optional)         |
        v                          |                    v
  ┌───────────────┐         ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
  │ RxDB Database │         │  Diff Server  │   │ RxDB Database │
  └───────────────┘         └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘
```

1. **Client 1** and **Client 2** connect via **WebRTC** for both database synchronization and AI streaming.
2. **Diff Server (Optional)** holds encrypted diffs if a direct P2P connection cannot be established at the time of an update.
3. All traffic between clients is **end-to-end encrypted** with a single symmetric account key.

---

## 4. Key Management and Zero-Knowledge Encryption

1. **Single Account Key** (per account): Each account owns a master symmetric key, often derived from a user passphrase via a Key Derivation Function (KDF). All message encryption and decryption is handled using this single key (or a key derived from it) without rotation.
2. **At-Rest Encryption** (Diffs on Diff Server):
   - When a diff is sent to the server, it is encrypted with the single symmetric key associated with the account.
   - The server never has the ability to decrypt the data (`zero-knowledge` from the server perspective).
3. **Identity Verification**: Each client must verify the other client is indeed part of the same `accountId` via a signature or shared secret-based challenge (depending on your security setup).

**Note**: We do not rotate keys under this design. If the key is compromised, the account owner should generate a new passphrase and re-derive a new key.

---

## 5. Connection Establishment and Signaling

Since we are using **WebRTC** with [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer):

1. **Signaling Server**: Clients connect to a signaling server via REST/WebSocket (implementation-specific).
2. **ICE Candidate Exchange**: The signaling server helps clients exchange ICE candidates, culminating in a WebRTC peer connection.
3. **Session Setup**: Once the peer connection is established, the client performs a secure handshake to verify the shared `accountId` (e.g., by exchanging a challenge-response encrypted with the account key or using a known signature scheme).

---

## 6. Message Format

All messages sent over WebRTC (or to/from the diff server) **must** be serialized (e.g., JSON) and then **encrypted** using the single account key. A typical wrapper may look like this:

```jsonc
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "accountId": "<uuid-or-string>",
  "clientId": "<unique-client-id>",
  "sessionId": "<unique-session-id>",
  "type": "<message-type>",
  "payload": "<encrypted-payload>" // ciphertext
}
```

Where `<encrypted-payload>` is typically a base64-encoded ciphertext. Once decrypted, the actual **payload** might look like:

```jsonc
// DECRYPTED PAYLOAD
{
  "op": "<operation>", // e.g., "DB_DIFF_PUSH", "AI_STREAM_INIT"
  "data": { /* operation-specific fields */ },
  "timestamp": 1696253450123 // or ISO-8601
}
```

Each **operation type** is defined in the following section.

---

## 7. Protocol Operations

### 7.1 Database Synchronization

**Goal:** Synchronize RxDB databases between two (or more) clients.

1. **DB_SYNC_INIT**
   - **Initiator**: A client that wants to check or push local changes.
   - **Payload**:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "DB_SYNC_INIT",
       "dbVersion": "<local-db-version>",
       "lastSyncTimestamp": "<timestamp>"
     }
     ```
   - **Behavior**: The receiving client compares versions or timestamps and decides what diffs to send back.

2. **DB_DIFF_PUSH**
   - **Initiator**: Client that has local changes (deltas) to broadcast.
   - **Payload**:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "DB_DIFF_PUSH",
       "changes": [ /* array of change objects */ ],
       "baseVersion": "<version-or-checkpoint>",
       "newVersion": "<version-or-checkpoint>"
     }
     ```
   - **Behavior**: The receiving client applies the changes, attempts conflict resolution if needed, and acknowledges.

3. **DB_DIFF_ACK**
   - **Initiator**: The receiving client after successfully applying the diff.
   - **Payload**:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "DB_DIFF_ACK",
       "ackVersion": "<applied-version>",
       "resolvedConflicts": [ /* optional array of conflict resolutions */ ]
     }
     ```

4. **DB_CONFLICT_RESOLVE** (if needed)
   - Used if the receiving client detects conflicts that it cannot auto-merge.
   - **Payload**:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "DB_CONFLICT_RESOLVE",
       "conflicts": [ /* data about the conflicting documents */ ],
       "clientResolution": [ /* resolved data or new revision info */ ]
     }
     ```
   - This can be part of the normal push/ack flow or a separate message.

### 7.2 Optional Diff Server Workflow

When a client is offline or the P2P channel cannot be established, the **diff server** can be used to store diffs temporarily. The workflow:

1. **Client 1** modifies the database.
   - Attempts direct P2P with **Client 2**:
     - If **connected**: send `DB_DIFF_PUSH` directly to Client 2.
     - If **not connected**: send an encrypted `DB_DIFF_PUSH` to the **diff server** with the additional key:
       ```jsonc
       {
         "op": "DB_DIFF_PUSH_SERVER",
         "accountId": "<account-id>",
         "targetClientId": "<client-2-id>",
         "encryptedDiff": "<encrypted-diff>"
       }
       ```
2. **Diff Server** stores the encrypted diff in a local SQLite DB keyed by `(accountId, targetClientId)`.
3. **Client 2** comes online:
   - Checks P2P with Client 1. If not directly reachable or if it chooses to do so for redundancy, it queries the diff server with:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "DB_DIFF_PULL_SERVER",
       "accountId": "<account-id>",
       "clientId": "<client-2-id>"
     }
     ```
   - **Diff Server** returns any stored `encryptedDiff`.
   - **Client 2** decrypts and applies the diffs, then sends a **DB_DIFF_ACK_SERVER** to the diff server:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "DB_DIFF_ACK_SERVER",
       "accountId": "<account-id>",
       "clientId": "<client-2-id>",
       "diffId": "<unique-diff-id>"
     }
     ```
   - **Diff Server** deletes the acknowledged diff from its store.

### 7.3 AI Inference Streaming

For local AI model inference, we can reuse the same WebRTC data channel and message format but define new operations:

1. **AI_STREAM_INIT**
   - **Initiator**: The client that will **send** inference data or results.
   - **Payload**:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "AI_STREAM_INIT",
       "modelId": "<model-identifier>",
       "sessionInfo": { /* any session metadata */ }
     }
     ```
   - The receiving client can accept or reject this streaming session.

2. **AI_STREAM_DATA**
   - **Initiator**: The client sending partial results of inference.
   - **Payload**:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "AI_STREAM_DATA",
       "token": "<generated-token-or-chunk-of-text>",
       "timestamp": "<timestamp>"
     }
     ```
   - *Use repeated messages to stream tokens or inference states over time.*

3. **AI_STREAM_END**
   - **Initiator**: The client that ends the inference session.
   - **Payload**:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "op": "AI_STREAM_END",
       "finalResult": "<final-string-or-object>"
     }
     ```
   - The receiving client acknowledges or simply closes the streaming channel.

**No diffs** are stored on the diff server for inference streaming. This is purely P2P ephemeral data.

---

## 8. Conflict Resolution

**RxDB** typically handles revision-based conflict resolution using a combination of:

- Document `_rev` fields or revision tokens.
- A known sequence of changes or a CRDT-like merge strategy.

### Recommended Approach:

1. When a conflict is detected (two or more changes to the same document with the same base `_rev`):
   - The receiving client merges or overwrites changes according to a policy (e.g., *last-write-wins*, *merge field by field*, or *custom function*).
2. The final resolved version is assigned a new `_rev`.
3. The updated document is broadcast back to the origin as part of the **ack** or a subsequent **diff push**.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

1. **Encryption**: All messages are encrypted end-to-end using the single account key (or a direct derivative from it) to ensure only authorized clients can decrypt.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Server**: The diff server receives only ciphertext and cannot decrypt it.
3. **Replay Attacks**:
   - Use a `timestamp` and/or a **nonce** in each message.
   - Keep track of recent nonces to prevent replays.
4. **Man-in-the-Middle**:
   - The initial handshake (or challenge) must be authenticated (e.g., with a signature from a known public key or a shared secret).
5. **Data Integrity**: Each message can include a cryptographic MAC (message authentication code) inside the ciphertext, ensuring that recipients detect tampering.

---

## 10. Implementation Recommendations

1. **Libraries**:
   - **simple-peer** for WebRTC P2P.
   - A robust encryption library that supports AES-GCM or Chacha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption.
2. **RxDB Integration**:
   - Use RxDB’s built-in replication or conflict handling hooks to implement the `DB_DIFF_PUSH` / `DB_DIFF_ACK` logic.
   - You may store inbound diffs in a “staging” area or do direct merges as they arrive.
3. **Diff Server**:
   - A minimal Node.js/Express server with a SQLite or an in-memory database can suffice.
   - Provide REST endpoints for:
     - `POST /pushDiff` → to store the diff
     - `POST /pullDiff` → to retrieve diffs
     - `POST /ackDiff` → to remove diffs once applied
   - Ensure SSL/HTTPS is used if clients connect over the public internet (the data is also end-to-end encrypted, but authenticity of the server host is important).
4. **Scalability**:
   - For more than 2 clients, the same protocol flow applies. Each client might broadcast diffs to all other connected peers or rely on the diff server as a fallback.
5. **Offline Support**:
   - The diff server helps only as an offline relay, not a full store.
   - Each client keeps its own local RxDB, always available offline.
6. **Error Handling**:
   - If a client fails to apply a diff, it returns a `DB_DIFF_NACK` or an error object.
   - The other peer can resend or log an error for manual resolution.

# Conclusion

This **P2P-first syncing and AI streaming protocol** provides a flexible, **end-to-end encrypted** system with an optional **diff server** for offline scenarios. The **zero-knowledge** design ensures that neither the signaling server nor the diff server can access user data or AI payloads in plaintext. By leveraging **WebRTC** with [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer), clients can directly synchronize their RxDB databases or exchange AI inference results in real time. When direct connections are unavailable, the diff server offers a lightweight, encrypted relay for database changes until the peers can reconnect.

By relying on a single account-linked key, implementation is simplified, though it’s important to have a plan for how to revoke or replace the key in case of compromise. Still, the protocol’s design remains both robust and extensible for future needs.
